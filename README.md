## Research Hypothesis and Objectives

The research explores how **data mining** and **text analytics** methods can enhance public health monitoring by utilizing **emerging data streams** such as:

- Social media data
- Wearable devices
- Health apps
- Environmental sensors

### Objectives:
1. **Analyze Novel Data Sources:** Assess the potential of diverse data streams for disease surveillance.
2. **Develop Analytical Tools:** Create data mining and text analytics tools to process new data sources.
3. **Evaluate Performance:** Test tools for predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and scalability.
4. **Integrate with Current Systems:** Ensure compatibility with traditional public health protocols.
5. **Disseminate Findings:** Share insights through publications and stakeholder engagement.
